<h1>Weather App</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
    This Weather App is a dynamic web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any location worldwide. The app displays current weather conditions, a 7-day forecast, and includes features such as unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit and dynamic weather-related GIFs. The goal of this project was to enhance my understanding of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while integrating external APIs to fetch and display real-time data.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Weather Data:</strong> Fetches and displays current weather conditions, including temperature and weather description.</li>
    <li><strong>7-Day Weather Forecast:</strong> Provides a detailed 7-day forecast with high and low temperatures, conditions, and corresponding weather icons.</li>
    <li><strong>Unit Conversion:</strong> Allows users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit for both current temperature and forecasted values.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic GIF Integration:</strong> Displays a relevant GIF based on the current weather conditions using the Giphy API.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive UI:</strong> Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, with modern aesthetics and a user-friendly interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> For structuring the content and providing the basic layout of the webpage.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> For styling the application, including simple & modern design features such as shadows, rounded corners, and responsive layouts.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript (ES6+):</strong> For handling the logic of the application, including fetching data from APIs, processing and displaying the data, and implementing interactive features like unit conversion.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual Crossing Weather API:</strong> Used to retrieve real-time weather data, including current conditions and a 7-day forecast.</li>
    <li><strong>Giphy API:</strong> Used to fetch and display GIFs based on the current weather conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Weather Icons:</strong> A library of weather-themed icons used to visually represent weather conditions in the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> For typography, enhancing the visual appeal of the text on the webpage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>
    Working on this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of several key web development concepts and technologies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> I learned how to integrate third-party APIs into a web application, including how to handle JSON data, process it, and display it dynamically on the webpage.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript DOM Manipulation:</strong> I gained more experience in manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, particularly in dynamically updating content based on user interactions and external data.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript:</strong> I practiced using asynchronous functions (<code>async</code>/<code>await</code>) to handle API requests, which is essential for creating smooth, non-blocking web applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>User Input:</strong> The user enters a location in the input field and submits the form.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Fetching:</strong> The app sends a request to the Visual Crossing Weather API to retrieve weather data for the specified location.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> The returned data is processed to extract relevant information, such as the current temperature, weather conditions, and a 7-day forecast.</li>
    <li><strong>Displaying Data:</strong> The app displays the current weather, including a dynamic GIF that matches the weather conditions. It also displays a detailed 7-day forecast.</li>
    <li><strong>Unit Conversion:</strong> Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit by clicking the "Switch to °F" or "Switch to °C" button, updating the temperature display accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Geolocation:</strong> Implementing automatic location detection using the Geolocation API.</li>
    <li><strong>Additional Data Points:</strong> Displaying more detailed weather information, such as humidity, UV index, and sunrise/sunset times.</li>
</ul>
